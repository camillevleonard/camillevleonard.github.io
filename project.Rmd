# Project Introduction 

On [January 12, 2010](en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2010_Haiti_earthquake), a magnitude 7.0 earthquake struck Haiti causing significant damage, which affected approximately 3 million citizens. In the wake of the disaster, aid groups were working to locate displaced persons to provide food and water. However, due to the large scale destruction of infrastructure over a wide area additional assistance was needed to locate people quickly. 


![Little is left of a neighborhood on a hillside near downtown Port-au-Prince on Jan. 15. More than a million people were displaced by the quake. ([David Gilkey/NPR](https://www.npr.org/sections/pictureshow/2020/01/12/794939899/haiti-in-ruins-a-look-back-at-the-2010-earthquake))](Images/NPR_destruction.jpg)


Displaced persons created make-shift shelters out of blue tarps. In order to locate displaced persons quickly, high resolution geo-refereneced images were captured by aircraft of the destroyed areas. The data generated by the image collection was too large for aid workers to process in time to supply aid. Therefore, a team from the [Rochester Institute of Technology](https://www.rit.edu/news/rit-captures-haiti-disaster-high-tech-imaging-system) used data-mining algorithms to analyze the images and identify blue tarps. The goal was to effectively locate displaced persons as quickly as possible and communicate their location to rescue workers so they could deliver resources to people in time.  

![Sample image of a geo-referenced image used for the analysis](Images/orthovnir071_makeshift_villiage1.jpg)

As the final project for SYS 6018 - Data Mining, we were assigned to use techniques we learned in the course to build models that would as accurately as possible, and in as timely a manner as possible, locate the greatest number of the displaced persons from the provided imagery data. The data made available to students consisted of a csv of red, green, blue pixel values and a class indicator which indicated if a pixel was representative of a blue tarp or something else like vegetation. 

We were also provided multiple text files that contained data and extra information to be used as a final hold out test set. We were expected to wrangle the data into a usable format.  

# Project Budget

The US Government spent [$1.5B on Haiti disaster relief](https://www.rand.org/pubs/research_reports/RR304.html) by the end of 2010. For this project, we will assume that $2,000,000 was allocated to our team to deliver supplies to displaced individuals in the immediate aftermath. Our team has been assigned an area where 2,022 displaced people are believed to be (this is the number of blue tarps are in our training data set). Anything less than a 80% delivery success rate will be considered a disaster relief failure. 80% of 2,022 people is 1,618. Therefore, if we fail to locate 404 of our blue tarps our mission would be considered a failure.      

These considerations will help guide the selection of thresholds later in the analysis.

## {.tabset }

The data provided for analysis was generated from overhead images and stored as a three channel output. Each pixel also had a classifier label indicating whether it was a blue tarp or something else like vegetation or soil. The channels represented the red, green, and blue values for pixels within images. RGB color model is referred to as an additive model. The integer value for the red, green, and blue channels are combined to represent a color. Typically, the component values are stored as an 8 bit integer ranging from 0 to 255. 

The data was visualized with the ggpairs function. For a pair of variables chosen from the data frame, [Ggpairs](https://www.r-graph-gallery.com/199-correlation-matrix-with-ggally.html#:~:text=The%20ggpairs()%20function%20of,left%20part%20of%20the%20figure.&text=Variable%20distribution%20is%20available%20on%20the%20diagonal.) generates a scatterplot, displays a Pearson correlation, and, on the diagonal, shows a variable distribution. The plots were also color-coded by class. The class label describes what kind of object a pixel is associated with. In our data frame there were the following classes: Blue Tarp, Rooftop, Soil, Various Non-tarp, and Vegetation. The 2D representation of the data only gives us a partial insight into the behavior and relationships of the predictors. Since three channels are used to generate a color, plotting the data in 3D to investigate trends and behavior between classes will be more meaningful. 

The 3D scatter plot shows a significant amount of overlap between the different classes. It is worth noting that it is possible to see some separation between the classes. 

### Check NA 

```{r 2,  results="hold"} 
df <- tibble(read.csv("HaitiPixels.csv")) #read in df
"Check for NA values" 
anyNA(df) #check for NA values 
"Summary of Data"
summary(df) #quick look at data
df$Class <- factor(df$Class) #make Class a factor variable. 
```
We can see from the output that there aren't any NA values that need to be removed or adjusted. The values in each predictor column fall within the expected 0 to 255 range. 


### Scatter and Correlation

```{r 3, message=FALSE}
#Reference [1]
# The palette with grey:
cbPalette <- c("#999999", "#E69F00", "#56B4E9", "#009E73",  "#CC79A7", "#0072B2", "#D55E00")
#"#F0E442",

#view scatter and correlations  
p <- ggpairs(df[,2:4], lower.panel = NULL, upper = list(continuous = wrap("cor", size = 3)), aes(color=df$Class)) #+ scale_fill_manual(values=cbPalette) 

#Reference: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/34740210/how-to-change-the-color-palette-for-ggallyggpairs/34743555
for(i in 1:p$nrow) {
  for(j in 1:p$ncol){
    p[i,j] <- p[i,j] + 
        scale_fill_manual(values=cbPalette) +
        scale_color_manual(values=cbPalette)  
  }
}

p

attach(df) #attach df variables 
```

All three predictors are highly correlated with one another, which is unsurprising given the way RGB values are used to represent colors. 

### 3D Scatter

```{r fig }
fig <- plot_ly(df, x=~Red, y=~Green, z=~Blue, color=~Class, colors=c("#999999", "#E69F00", "#56B4E9", "#009E73",  "#CC79A7")) #Reference: https://plotly.com/r/3d-scatter-plots/ https://plotly.com/r/3d-surface-plots/
fig <- fig %>% add_markers()
fig <- fig %>% layout(scene=list(xaxis=list(title="Red"),
                     yaxis = list(title = 'Green'),
                     zaxis = list(title = 'Blue')))

fig
```

## Prepare Data Frame for Analysis {.tabset }

\

### Data Frame

As noted in the previous section, the data provided is sufficiently cleaned only one further adjustment to the data frame is needed. Since our main interest is to predict whether a pixel represents a blue tarp or not a blue tarp, the Class column of the data frame needs to be converted into a binary indicator for blue tarp or not blue tarp. 

```{r 4,  results="hold"}
df <- cbind(mutate(df, "Blue_Tarp_or_Not"=ifelse(Class != "Blue Tarp", 0, 1))) #add binary column indicating whether the Class variable is "Blue Tarp" or not
attach(df)
df$Blue_Tarp_or_Not <- factor(Blue_Tarp_or_Not, labels = c("NBT", "BT"))#, levels =c(0,1), labels = c("NBT", "BT")) #ensure new column is a factor 
"First Six Rows of Data Frame"
head(df)
df_factor  <- df[, -1]
"Last Six Rows of Data Frame"
tail(df_factor)
attach(df_factor)
```


### 3D Scatter - Binary

```{r fig 1}
fig1 <- plot_ly(df_factor, x=~Red, y=~Green, z=~Blue, color=~Blue_Tarp_or_Not, colors = cbPalette) #Reference: https://plotly.com/r/3d-scatter-plots/ https://plotly.com/r/3d-surface-plots/
fig1 <- fig1 %>% add_markers()
fig1 <- fig1 %>% layout(scene=list(xaxis=list(title="Red"),
                     yaxis = list(title = 'Green'),
                     zaxis = list(title = 'Blue')))

fig1
```

After the class label is converted into a binary classifier, it is easier to see separation between the data points for blue tarps and not blue tarps. In the region with RGB values of about 95 to about 130 there is more overlap than there is separation of the two classes. Observations that fall in this region will likely to be difficult to correctly classify for some predictors.  


```{r Data Subset for Quick Runs, eval=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
set.seed(4)
#In order to make run times faster when tuning parameters subset data with 20%
trainIndex <- createDataPartition(df_factor$Blue_Tarp_or_Not, p=0.2,
                                  list=FALSE,
                                  times=1)
df_subset <- df_factor[trainIndex,]
```


# Model Fitting

A few general notes on the various metrics and considerations that will be explored for each model.

**ROC**

The receiver operating characteristic or [ROC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receiver_operating_characteristic) is a graphic which illustrates the true positive percentage and the false positive percentage produced by the fit model at different threshold values. Generally, we seek to maximize the true positive rate (TPR) and minimize the false positive rate (FPR). 

For this project, are interested in maximizing the TPR and minimizing the FPR. However, our use case involves saving lives. Therefore, we are very concerned with the false negative rate. We want to avoid missed blue tarps, as best we can with the budget we're allowed. Due to the imbalance in the ratio of our BT and NBT observations, we must be concerned with the FPs (NBTs flagged as BTs) depleting our available resources before we are able to find all the blue tarps (TP). 

**AUC** 

The area under the curve or [AUC](https://towardsdatascience.com/understanding-auc-roc-curve-68b2303cc9c5) is a metric that indicates how well a model can differentiate between two classes.The higher the AUC the better the model is at predicting class labels correctly.  

**Thresholds** 

It can be difficult to determine what threshold to choose for your model from just an ROC curve alone. To aid in threshold selection I decided to graph the TPR, FPR, and threshold  in a 3-D scatterplot. As you will see from the interactive graphics, it's much easier to determine which threshold will give you the model performance that is appropriate for your application. In our case, our threshold selection is guided by the aim of maximizing the TPR while minimizing the FPR and ensuring that our operation does not exhaust our budget by pursuing incorrectly labeled not blue tarps (false positives) before we reach our success criterion.  

**Confusion Matrix**

The [confusion matrix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confusion_matrix) displays the true negatives, false negatives, false positives, and true positives giving a sense of the performance of a model. These values are used to calculate metrics which are commonly used to compare the performance of models such as the TPR (also known as sensitivity or recall), FPR, FNR, true negative rate (specificity), precision, etc. 

**Sampling Variability**

Understanding the confidence of the model you've created is critical to understanding how well your model will perform when given a new data set with a different values. How much variability can you expect from your model?  

## Logistic Regression {.tabset }

Logistic regression is classification technique, which, for our purposes, will be used to perform binary classification. Our logistic regression model calculates the probability that an observation is a blue tarp. The method of maximum likelihood is used to calculate the log likelihood for a prediction which is converted to a probability. Whether these probabilities are classified as a blue tarp or not a blue tarp is dependent on the threshold value chosen. A probability above the threshold value is assigned a blue tarp label and a probability below the threshold is assigned a not blue tarp label. 

### Model 

```{r Log Reg, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE,  results="hold"}
#pass
fitControl <- trainControl(method = "cv",
                           number = 10,
                           returnResamp = 'all',
                           savePredictions = 'final',
                           classProbs = TRUE) 

set.seed(4)
tic("Log. Reg.")
glm.fit <- caret::train(Blue_Tarp_or_Not~Red+Green+Blue,
                    data = df_factor,
                    method="glm",
                    family="binomial",
                    trControl= fitControl)
glm.time <- toc(quiet = TRUE)
glm.fit

"Summary"
summary(glm.fit)

```

The model fit summary output indicates that the three predictors all have significant p-values, meaning that they all are contributing to the model. The accuracy output indicates that over ten folds the average accuracy was 99.5%. Further discussion of the variability over ten folds can be found in the Sampling Variability tab.

### ROC

```{r Log Reg pred,  results="hold"}
#pass
glm.prob <- predict(glm.fit, newdata=df_factor , type = "prob") #returns df with col 0 (prob not blue tarp) and 1 (prob blue tarp)
par(pty="s")
glm_roc <- roc(df_factor $Blue_Tarp_or_Not, glm.prob[,2], plot=TRUE, legacy.axes=TRUE, percent=TRUE, xlab="False Positive Percentage", ylab="True Positive Percentage", col="#0072B2", lwd=4, print.auc=TRUE, main="Log. Reg. ROC Curve") 
```

An AUC of 99.9% indicates that our model is able to distinguish between the classes almost perfectly. It should be possible to choose a threshold that can identify most of the training blue tarps without going over our budget. 

### Thresholds

```{r LR Thresholds,  results="hold"}
roc.info_glm <- roc(df_factor$Blue_Tarp_or_Not, glm.prob[,2], legacy.axes=TRUE)
roc.glm.df <- data.frame(tpp=roc.info_glm$sensitivities*100, fpp=(1-roc.info_glm$specificities)*100, thresholds=roc.info_glm$thresholds)
#roc.glm.df[roc.glm.df>98.5 & roc.glm.df < 99,]

glm.thresholds <- data.matrix(roc.glm.df$thresholds)

fig2 <- plot_ly(roc.glm.df, x=~tpp, y=~fpp, z=~thresholds, colors = "#0072B2") #Reference: https://plotly.com/r/3d-scatter-plots/ https://plotly.com/r/3d-surface-plots/
fig2 <- fig2 %>% add_markers()
fig2 <- fig2 %>% layout(scene=list(xaxis=list(title="True Positive Rate"),
                     yaxis = list(title = 'False Positive Rate'),
                     zaxis = list(title = 'Threshold')))

fig2
```

### Confusion Matrix

```{r Log Reg Confusion Matrix,  results="hold"}
lr.thresh <- 0.03265
glm.pred_thresh <- factor(ifelse(glm.prob[,2]>lr.thresh,"BT", "NBT"), levels=c("NBT", "BT"))
cm.glm_thresh <- confusionMatrix(factor(glm.pred_thresh),df_factor $Blue_Tarp_or_Not, positive = "BT") 
"Threshold:"
lr.thresh
cm.glm_thresh

acc_LR <- cm.glm_thresh[["overall"]][["Accuracy"]]*100
auc_LR <- glm_roc[["auc"]]
thresh_LR <- lr.thresh
sens_LR <-  cm.glm_thresh[["byClass"]][["Sensitivity"]]*100
spec_LR <- cm.glm_thresh[["byClass"]][["Specificity"]]*100
FDR_LR <- ((cm.glm_thresh[["table"]][2,1])/(cm.glm_thresh[["table"]][2,1]+cm.glm_thresh[["table"]][2,2]))*100
prec_LR <- cm.glm_thresh[["byClass"]][["Precision"]]*100
F.glm <- round(2*((prec_LR*sens_LR)/(prec_LR+sens_LR))/100, 2)
beta_val <- 3
F3.glm <- round(((1+beta_val**2)*((prec_LR*sens_LR)/(beta_val*prec_LR+sens_LR)))/100, 2)

cost.glm <- round(cm.glm_thresh[["table"]][1]*0 + cm.glm_thresh[["table"]][2]*FP_C + cm.glm_thresh[["table"]][3]*FN_C + cm.glm_thresh[["table"]][4]*TP_C, 4)
cost.glm
```

A threshold of `r lr.thresh` was selected for this model. 

### Sampling Variability 

```{r LR Sampling Variablity,  results="hold" }
"10 Fold Results"
glm.fit$resample #point est +/- std from 10 folds "variation in the third decimal place"... 
glm.sd <- sd(glm.fit[["resample"]][["Accuracy"]]*100)
#plot(glm.fit[["resample"]][["Accuracy"]], main="Accuracy per Fold", xlab= "Fold Number", ylab="Accuracy")
```

The average accuracy across ten folds is `r round(acc_LR, 2)` with a standard deviation of `r round(glm.sd, 3)`. Based on the k folds accuracy performance, which exhibits variation in the thousands place, we can have confidence in the model performing well even when there is some variation in the data. However, if another data set is significantly different than the training data set there could be a considerable change in performance. 

## LDA {.tabset }

LDA is a classification method that uses the maximum likelihood method to classify observations. LDA assumes each class has a normal distribution and that every covariance is the same.This creates a linear separation boundary between classes. The observation is assigned to the class with the highest calculated likelihood. Caret automatically does the calculation to convert the likelihood to a probability, which is what we use in conjunction with our chosen threshold to classify our data.  

### Model

```{r LDA,  results="hold"}
#pass
fitControl <- trainControl(method = "cv",
                           number = 10,
                           returnResamp = 'all',
                           savePredictions = 'final',
                           classProbs = TRUE)

set.seed(4)
tic("LDA")
lda.fit <- caret::train(Blue_Tarp_or_Not~Red+Green+Blue,
                    data = df_factor,
                    preProcess=c("center","scale"),
                    method="lda",
                    verbose= FALSE,
                    trControl= fitControl)
lda.time <- toc(quiet = TRUE)
lda.fit
```

### ROC 

```{r LDA pred,  results="hold"}
#pass
lda.prob <- predict(lda.fit, newdata=df_factor, type = "prob") #returns df with col 0 (prob not blue tarp) and 1 (prob blue tarp)
par(pty="s")
lda_roc <- roc(df_factor$Blue_Tarp_or_Not, lda.prob[,2], plot=TRUE, legacy.axes=TRUE, percent=TRUE, xlab="False Positive Percentage", ylab="True Positive Percentage", col="#0072B2", lwd=4, print.auc=TRUE, main="LDA ROC Curve") 
```

An AUC of 98.9% indicates that our model is able to distinguish between the classes pretty well. With a higher false positive percentage where the true positive percentage is near 100% it will likely be more difficult to choose a threshold that can identify most of the training blue tarps without going over our budget. 

### Thresholds

```{r LDA Thresholds,  results="hold"}
roc.info_lda <- roc(df_factor $Blue_Tarp_or_Not, lda.prob[,2], legacy.axes=TRUE)
roc.lda.df <- data.frame(tpp=roc.info_lda$sensitivities*100, fpp=(1-roc.info_lda$specificities)*100, thresholds=roc.info_lda$thresholds)
#roc.lda.df[roc.lda.df>91.5 & roc.lda.df < 91.6,]

fig3 <- plot_ly(roc.lda.df, x=~tpp, y=~fpp, z=~thresholds, colors = "#0072B2") #Reference: https://plotly.com/r/3d-scatter-plots/ https://plotly.com/r/3d-surface-plots/
fig3 <- fig3 %>% add_markers()
fig3 <- fig3 %>% layout(scene=list(xaxis=list(title="True Positive Rate"),
                     yaxis = list(title = 'False Positive Rate'),
                     zaxis = list(title = 'Threshold')))

fig3
```

### Confusion Matrix 

```{r LDA Confusion Matrix,  results="hold"}
lda.thresh <- 0.01

lda.pred_thresh <- factor(ifelse(lda.prob[,2]>lda.thresh,"BT", "NBT"), levels=c("NBT", "BT"))
cm.lda_thresh <- confusionMatrix(factor(lda.pred_thresh),df_factor$Blue_Tarp_or_Not, positive = "BT") 
"Threshold:"
lda.thresh
cm.lda_thresh

acc_lda <- cm.lda_thresh[["overall"]][["Accuracy"]]*100
auc_lda <- lda_roc[["auc"]]
thresh_lda <- lda.thresh
sens_lda <-  cm.lda_thresh[["byClass"]][["Sensitivity"]]*100
spec_lda <- cm.lda_thresh[["byClass"]][["Specificity"]]*100
FDR_lda <- ((cm.lda_thresh[["table"]][2,1])/(cm.lda_thresh[["table"]][2,1]+cm.lda_thresh[["table"]][2,2]))*100
prec_lda <- cm.lda_thresh[["byClass"]][["Precision"]]*100
F.lda <- round(2*((prec_lda*sens_lda)/(prec_lda+sens_lda))/100, 2)
F3.lda <- round(((1+beta_val**2)*((prec_lda*sens_lda)/(beta_val*prec_lda+sens_lda)))/100, 2)

cost.lda <- round(cm.lda_thresh[["table"]][1]*0 + cm.lda_thresh[["table"]][2]*FP_C + cm.lda_thresh[["table"]][3]*FN_C + cm.lda_thresh[["table"]][4]*TP_C, 4)
cost.lda
```

Based on the performance of the LDA model, I was unable to find a threshold that satisfied the budget. Therefore, I chose a threshold that minimized cost and number of false negatives. 

### Sampling Variability 

```{r LDA Sampling Variablity,  results="hold" }
"10 Fold Results"
lda.fit$resample  
lda.sd <- sd(lda.fit[["resample"]][["Accuracy"]]*100)
```

The average accuracy across ten folds is `r round(acc_lda, 2)` with a standard deviation of `r round(lda.sd, 3)`. Based on the k folds accuracy performance, which exhibits variation in the thousands place, we can have confidence in the model performing well even when there is some variation in the data. However, if another data set is significantly different than the training data set there could be a considerable change in performance. 

## QDA {.tabset }

QDA is a classification method that uses the maximum likelihood method to classify observations. QDA assumes each class has a normal distribution. Each class has its own mean and covariance. The observation is assigned to the class with the highest calculated likelihood. Caret automatically does the calculation to convert the likelihood to a probability, which is what we use in conjunction with our chosen threshold to classify our data.

The decision boundary created by QDA is quadratic and allows for different covariances for the classes. Therefore, you will see better performance of a QDA model compared to a LDA model when the boundary between classes of data is non-linear and the classes have different covariance values. 

### Model

```{r QDA,  results="hold"}
#pass
fitControl <- trainControl(method = "cv",
                           number = 10,

An AUC of 99.8% indicates that our model is able to distinguish between the classes very well. It should be possible to choose a threshold that can identify most of the training blue tarps without going over our budget.

The average accuracy across ten folds is `r round(acc_qda, 2)` with a standard deviation of `r round(qda.sd, 3)`. Based on the k folds accuracy performance, which exhibits variation in the thousands place, we can have confidence in the model performing well even when there is some variation in the data. However, if another data set is significantly different than the training data set there could be a considerable change in performance.  

## KNN {.tabset }

K nearest neighbors is a modeling method that calculates the probability an observation belongs to one class or another based on the class of its k nearest neighbors (observations closest in data space to the observation we're trying to classify) are assigned to. K values of 5 or 10 are often chosen to avoid too much bias (happens when k is too big) and too much variance (happens when K is too small).

## Random Forest {.tabset }

Random forest is a classification method that uses a large number of averaged decorrelated decision trees to assign a class to an observation. Decorrelation is accomplished by limiting the number of predictors the trees may use to split the data. To assign a class to a new observation, the observation is classified by all the trees in the model and assigned a final classification based on which class the largest number of trees assigned to that observation. 

### Model

                           savePredictions = 'final',

```

The RF model was fit on 500 trees and the tuning parameter mtry=2 (number of variables chosen at each sample split) was selected. The difference in accuracy between mtry=2 and mtry=3 incredibly small (hundred thousandths place).

## SVM {.tabset }

Support vector machines or [SVMs](https://towardsdatascience.com/support-vector-machine-introduction-to-machine-learning-algorithms-934a444fca47) are a classification (or regression) technique that generates a hyperplane in N-dimensional space to separate the classes. This is accomplished by choosing the hyperplane that creates the largest margin between the classes. SVM is touted as one of the best classifiers when the data is numeric and continuous (which is not our use case though we will see SVm does a good job predicting on our data set) and the right kernel is used.

Support vectors are data points that are closest to the hyperplane and influence its position and orientation. They fall within the allowable margin on either side of the hyperplane. The SVM model produces a score between -1 and 1 for each observation. The sign of the score indicates which class the model assigned the observation to. 

Based on the way caret has been programmed, the predict function creates probabilities instead of scores. This will allow a threshold to be chosen to generate confusion matrices.

Both linear and poly SVM functions were considered. Radial SVM produced the highest accuracy values, by less than a percentage point, of the three methods. SVM radial was chosen for building the SVM model. 

The best tuning parameters selected for the radial model fit were sigma = 9.020118 and C = 128.

### ROC

An AUC of 99.9% indicates that our model is able to distinguish between the classes almost perfectly. It should be possible to choose a threshold that can identify most of the training blue tarps without going over our budget.

# Hold-Out Test Sample {.tabset}

A model fit to maximize performance on its training data set is not guaranteed to perform well on future data sets. If a model has been overtrained, then there will be significant variation in the performance of the model on future data sets. Here we have a test data set that we will use to test the performance of the final models. There are approximately 2 million data points in this data set. 

In the subsections below, the final fit models will predict the class of the test data. A confusion matrix and ROC curve are shown for each model. A collective summary table and comparison of model performance are located in later sections.

**Selection and Interpretation of Tuning Parameters:**

Three models - KNN, RF, and SVM -  had tuning parameters. 

KNN’s tuning parameter was k which represents the number of observations that the model is told to use to determine which class a new observation is assigned to. My  code specified a tuneLength of 10, which resulted a model being fit for ten different k values. The following values were tried for k: 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, 17, 19, 21, 23. The k with the highest accuracy, k=7, was selected as the best fit and used for the final mode. 

RF’s tuning parameter was mtry. This parameter represents the number of variables chosen at each sample split as the trees are created. Due to there only being three predictors, values of mtry=2 and mtry = 3 were considered. The model fit with mtry=2 produced a higher accuracy than mtry=3 and was selected as the best fit. It should be noted that difference in accuracy between mtry=2 and mtry=3 incredibly small (hundred thousandths place). I would also like to comment that the parameter ntrees, the number of trees built to fit the model, can also be specified for the model. Caret automatically chose 500 trees. Based on the high accuracy produced by 500 trees I did not investigate this parameter further.  

SVM has two tuning parameters C, the cost penalty (which ultimately controls the margin size), and sigma, a scaling factor for the exponential behavior (which referred to as gamma in our textbook). More specifically, this sigma parameter is called the “inverse width parameter in the Gaussian Radial Basis kernel”. The larger your C value the bigger the penalty for misclassifications. This results in fewer support vectors and a smaller margin. Small margins result in lower bias and higher variance. With caret a tuneLength = 10 was run. Ten values for C were fit on different models. Trying to explain how sigma was chosen, I realized only one sigma value was used when tuneLength is called. [This thread]( https://stackoverflow.com/questions/38859705/r-understanding-caret-traintunelength-and-svm-methods-from-kernlab) indicates that svmRadial chooses a single sigma based on the output from [sigest]( https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/kernlab/versions/0.9-29/topics/sigest) a function from the kernlab library. Per the function’s description, sigest returns a range of values for sigma which will return good results. I assume svmRadial chooses one of those sigma values, on what basis this decision is made I’m not sure. If I had realized this sooner, I could have used svmRadialSigma which tunes over both cost and sigma. 

Returning to the explanation of what parameters were chosen, C = 128 and sigma = 9.020118. These were the parameters that created the best fit of the model from the 10 options provided by tuneLength. If I had more time to play with the project I would investigate the difference in performance between a model fit with C = 32 and C = 128 on the FHO data. There's only 0.0000475% difference in the accuracy of models fit with those C values. A smaller C would result in a larger margin. It is possible that with a wider margin there could be better performance in predicting the FHO data. 

### Time Considerations

The time it took for each model to be fit and the time to run predictions on the FHO data set were recorded. These run times are not absolute they will vary based on hardware differences between devices that run these algorithms and the size of the data sets passed to the functions (if the data sets are changed). Therefore, this is a qualitative measure that can be used to compare the run times of the algorithms. 

```{r Model Fit Run Time, results="hold"}

mfrt.glm <- round((glm.time$toc-glm.time$tic), 2) 
mfrt.lda <- round((lda.time$toc-lda.time$tic), 2)
mfrt.qda <- round((qda.time$toc-qda.time$tic), 2) 
mfrt.knn <- round((knn.time$toc-knn.time$tic), 2) 
mfrt.rf <- round((rf.time$toc-rf.time$tic), 2)
mfrt.svm <- round((svm.time$toc-svm.time$tic), 2)

```

# Conclusions 

I have reordered the conclusions provided to us in the project description based on what I think provides the best flow for this section.

**A discussion of the relevance of the metrics calculated in the tables to this application context**

Accuracy

Accuracy is a misleading metric for our application. A high accuracy, the percentage of predictions that are correct, does not guarantee we will be able to effectively achieve the goals of the use case. This is especially true for this project, where achieving a high true positive rate is paramount to successfully executing the mission but the data set is imbalanced. The further we push the threshold to maximize the TPR the larger the number of false positives we will predict with the model. False positives cost us resources of which we don't have an unlimited supply. They also waste time, another resource we are limited in. Therefore, a high accuracy does not provide us with the information we need to know our model will help us achieve our primary objective.    

AUC 

The area under the curve acts like a quick check as we compare performance between models. This metric quantifies how well a model is able to differentiate between classes. It is a good piece of information but not a critical metric that will help us decide which model will perform the best for this application. 

ROC and Threshold

ROC and threshold aren't performance metrics so they aren't helpful in comparing the performance of the algorithms directly. However, the ROC curve is generated by reported performance metrics (TPR and FPR) at different threshold values. Thresholds set the decision point to determine which class an observation is assigned to. The prediction function produces a probability that is compared to the threshold value and then a class is assigned. By adjusting the threshold we can maximize a metric such as the TPR. So, the ROC and threshold are important in helping us generate and adjust the metrics that are most relevant to our use case.   

Precision and Recall 

The metrics that indicate performance most relevant to our use case are precision and recall. Our primary goal is to correctly identify blue tarps, maximize the true positive rate, so that aid can be provided to the people associated with the blue tarp. Recall quantifies how many TP are identified of the total possible number that could be identified. Therefore, it's indicating the percentage of blue tarps we've identified  of all the blue tarps that are there to be identified. It's critical we achieve the highest recall we can within our limitations because FN are effectively deaths. 

Due to the imbalance in proportion between the classes in the data set, we have to be concerned with the number of false positive as well. The precision metric, which quantifies the percentage of TP classified of the predicted positive condition (TP + FP), represents this concern. Identifying all 2,022 blue tarps in our data set (maximizing the TPR) does us no good if we also identify 10,000 not blue tarps (have a high FPR). Taking the time to travel to 10,000 extra and incorrect locations would result in a staggering waste of resources and loss of life as aid workers run out of time to deliver supplies to displaced persons. To maximize the precision the algorithm has to have a high number of TP and a low number of FP.  

Specificity

Specificity is the true negative rate or (1 - FPR). This metric indicates how well the model is classifying its negative condition. While we are somewhat concerned about how well the model is classifying true negatives as negatives, there is no penalty for a TN. A TN costs us $0 in this use case. Our false negatives and false positives are a larger concern to us. This makes the FPR and precision a larger focus for us.    

FDR

The false discovery rate (FDR) indicates what percentage of our predicted positive condition is actually false positives. False positives for us waste time and resources. The FDR is the opposite metric of precision. Therefore, as we control the precision and maximize it we will minimize the FDR.   

**Discussion of budget and threshold selection **

As is the reality of an aid or disaster relief situation, there are not unlimited resources to provide aid to those effected by the disaster. To assist in creating a more real life example, a budget was created to guide threshold selection. Our aim was to maximize the number of TP while minimizing the FP and ensuring that our operation does not exhaust our allowed budget. The budget would be quickly exhausted by pursuing incorrectly labeled not blue tarps (false positives). 

Additionally, an overall success percentage of 80% was added to make the operation success qualification more stringent. Allocating millions of dollars to provide life saving resources to displaced persons would be considered a political and international relations nightmare if a certain percentage of success was not achieved. 

In our training data set we know that there are 2,022 displaced persons hidden within 63,241 observations. In order for our mission to be considered a success 80% of the 2,022 displaced persons (1,618 people) must be identified and provided resources. Our mission was allocated $2,000,000 to locate the 2,022 displaced persons assigned to us. If we fail to find 404 of these people our mission is a failure, regardless of the cost of the mission. Therefore, to numerically force failure if we don't identify 404 of the TP as TP the cost of a FN is calculated to be \$2,000,000/404. That will keep us from being able to come in under budget. As previously stated in the "Project Budget" section, the cost of a TP is \$1,000 and a FP is \$300. 

This budget limit guided me in the selection of threshold values. First, I sought to produce the lowest number of FN and FP. This typically resulted in the project being over budget. I then adjusted the threshold to still keep the FN as low as possible but allowed more FP.   

Based on the chosen threshold values, random forest had the lowest cost then KNN and SVM. Logistic regression and QDA were just under budget. No matter the threshold I chose, I could not get LDA under budget. I chose a threshold that resulted in the lowest cost for this model. The LDA confusion matrix had the highest number of FN of all the models thus accounting for the lowest recall percentage. 


**A discussion of the best performing algorithm(s) in the cross-validation and hold-out data**

Based on the cross-validation data set recall and precision, I rank the models from highest to least likely to recommend (notes next to name indicate what I considered as I chose the rankings):

1. Random forest - high recall, highest precision, low cost
2. KNN - perfect recall, high precision, low cost
3. SVM - high recall, high precision
4. Logistic regression - high recall, higher precision than QDA
5. QDA - high recall, low precision
6. LDA - lowest recall, lowest precision, over budget

The algorithm that performed the best on the cross-validation data, as decided by recall, precision, cost (metrics were listed in order of importance), was the random forest algorithm. KNN and SVM get honorable mentions based on their recall, precision, and cost metrics. 

Logistic regression, LDA, and QDA have low precision percentages compared to RF, KNN, and SVM. This can be explained the large number of FP predicted by those models compared to RF, KNN, SVM. 

|Model: | FP | TP |
|------:|:--:|:--:|
|RF     | 16 |2,000|
|KNN    | 534|2,022|
|SVM    | 845|2,018|
|Log. Reg.|1,048|1,982|
|LDA    |1,275| 1,791|
|QDA    |1,412| 2,008| 


Based on the final hold out data set recall, precision, I rank the models from highest to least likely to recommend (notes next to name indicate what I considered as I chose the rankings):

1. LDA - second best recall (95.7%), third best precision 
2. Random forest - okay recall (83.5%), best precision
3. KNN  - pretty good recall (93.2%), second best precision
4. QDA - good recall, good precision
5. SVM - worst recall, okay precision
6. Logistic regression - perfect recall, 222,000+ FP making for worst precision 

All qualitative descriptions are relative to the five other models. I am not impressed with any of the models when it comes to their performance. I decided to place LDA at the top of the list since it had a small number of FN and okay FP numbers. 

**A discussion or analysis justifying why your findings above are compatible or reconcilable**

I am a bit surprised by the difference in model performance between the training and test data sets. I wouldn't say that the performance was very consistent for the models between data sets. I have to consider whether there is a difference between the training and test sets or if my models were overfit to training data set. 

Below the training data set and the FHO data set (a subset) are graphed. I don't see a significant difference in the separation of the two classes.

For our logistic regression model, it looks like the threshold chosen for the cross-validation data set is not appropriate for our test data set. The algorithm perfectly predicts the TP at a threshold higher than 0.03265. Due to that, an incredibly high number of NBT to be classified as BT resulting in a 11% FPR. 

The LDA model performs with a higher TPR on the FHO than the training data set. My hypothesis is that the FHO data better satisfies the assumptions of LDA for example its possible that each class is more concentrated within the center of its Gaussian distribution such that fewer predictions are near the decision boundary. If more of the observations are far from the decision boundary (predicted probability is far from the threshold) then you'd see better performance. 

The QDA decision boundary that was modeled for the training data set must not match the shape of the decision boundary as well for the FHO data because we're not able to get 100% TPR without at least ~10% FPR. That must mean that about 10% of the NBT data is on the wrong side of the decision boundary. We are seeing improved performance for the LDA model on the FHO. So, I think it's possible that the linear decision boundary does a better job of separating the data.  

For KNN, with a much larger data set k = 7 may no longer be the best setting for the tuning parameter, resulting in higher error. Because there are so many more data points now 7 neighbors probably isn't enough to accurately predict the class in heavy overlap regions. 

For RF, because the model is made by the average of 500 trees if the test data set has a shift in one direction or another or a large number of data points sit on boundaries a significant amount of misclassification could occur.  If that were the case then there would be a percentage of data points you couldn't classify correctly, like were seeing with the FHO data. 

SVM the margin may be too narrow or incorrectly placed for the test data set or there could be a pocket of data on the wrong side of the margin. Because SVM sets a decision boundary in a point in space if the data shifts around it and violates the margin then a large number of incorrect predictions would result. That could explain the difference in performance and shape of the FHO ROC curve.  

I think collectively what I've outlined for most of these methods is that the FHO data set has at least a portion of data that violates the previously defined decision boundary (with the exception of logistic regression) so that the models can't predict the TPR at 100% without a significant percentage of FPs. For logistic regression I think the threshold is the wrong value allowing a large number of FP to be predicted. 

**A recommendation and rationale regarding which algorithm to use for detection of blue tarps**

If we aren't allowed to make any adjustments to the models and threshold values based on what we learned from the FHO, then I would recommend the LDA model be used to detect blue tarps. All of our models exceed an 80% TPR which is a success, however, some have a FPR that would be too costly (logistic regression) and others have prediction run times that when deployed to scale would never stop running (KNN and SVM). LDA and QDA have similar recall and precision numbers but LDA's recall is 3.3% better. It is possible that this difference could be attributed to the variation between samples. If we had another 2 million data points to test it is possible QDA could come out on top that time. In the end, we have to make a decision and based on what information I have at present, LDA is my pick.

If we were allowed to make some additional adjustments, I think the logistic regression model could be refined a little bit more to pare down the FPR and make it a useful model. The AUC for the training and test data sets was 99.9% both times, which means the model does a great job differentiating between the classes. The main issue was the threshold value selection. Having two million data points to train the model on would allow for better threshold selection. 

**Future Work** 

Only having three predictors, RGB values, leave a lot to be desired when making a predictive model. Especially, when the three predictors are in effect an additive singular predictor, a color. Grated, given a disaster situation, having frequently imaged areas available for review is no small feat and being able to have any data at all is great. There must be a way to further innovate, right? To collect some more data from somewhere to help improve the model. The group from Rochester Institute of Technology used LIDAR data in their predictive models. I know that LIDAR data can be used to classify damage to infrastructure by calculating change in the height of structures from previous satellite imagery. So I think that LIDAR data should be explored in addition to the RGB data. 

In a similar vein, there has been work done to develop infrastructure damage classifications that can be applied to satellite imagery through machine learning. There is a [data base](https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.09296v1) that has been created to help further this work. It can be used to take before images where structures are identified with polygons and compare them with after images. The changes in the polygons help to classify the scale of damage. I think something of this nature could be used to identify this kind of damage and indicate where displaced persons might be in a somewhat urban environment. I'm wondering if this could be applied in some way to identify tarp polygons. 

If that didn't work then maybe this kind of technology could be used to track if roads and pathways to travel had been effected. You could pull satellite data from before the event, identify the main routes of travel, secondary routes, then feed the algorithm daily image updates to see if any of the paths of travel have been compromised in some way. 

More specifically related to my work, if I had more time I would make precision / recall/ threshold 3-D plots like I made for the ROC curves. It would be interesting to compare the two methods and probably would have helped me pick better threshold values. It was rather late in my analysis that I realized I should focus more on the precision and recall metrics. If you look back in my tables you'll see I've added F~1~ and F~3~ metrics. The F~3~ metric places 3x the emphasis on recall over precision. The closer the score is to 3 the higher the recall and precision, with the emphasis on the recall. I like the F scores and think they are a handy metric when you're concerned about precision and recall for your application, like ours. 

Being able to compare the precision and recall rates with the algorithm execution time helped me when deciding which algorithms would be best suited for this application. Keeping algorithmic complexity in mind, it would likely be worthwhile for aid workers to run new observations through the model in smaller batch sizes so that new predictions could be reported frequently to the field.  It would be even better if the field kept track of whether a location was a TP or FP. Then that data, now validated, could be used to retrain and update the model.
